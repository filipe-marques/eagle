### Contributing to Eagle PHP Bootstrap project

Here are the rules to promote a good relationship between developers and the community:

#### Issues

1. Be polite and kind;
2. Describe what happens and how to test to reproduce that error;

#### Pull requests

1. To fix a issue: one pull request per issue;
2. To implement an idea: one pull request per idea;

#### Development

1. Always develop new features, fix bugs in dev branch, after finish develop, merge dev into master branch of your forked repo;
2. Do pull requests to target the dev branch;

This avoids confusion between revisions of source code!

#### Software need for coding or testing

* [PHP 5](https://php.net/), MySQL (MariaDB) (phpMyAdmin) (optional for database applications), PHP Built-in Web Server (for development) or Apache (for production) ;
* Good Knowledge of [PHP](http://php.net/) ;
* [git](http://git-scm.com/) ;

#### Have a happy coding ! :thumbsup:
